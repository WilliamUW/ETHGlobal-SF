# Ether Go 🦊🌍

🚀 **Our Mission:**
Ether Go is like **Pokémon Go** but for **real animals**! We’re solving the $2.1 billion wildlife tracking problem by crowdsourcing it—onboarding millions into the world of **crypto** while preserving nature. Imagine snapping a picture of a wild animal and minting an **immutable record** on the **Ethereum blockchain**! 🌱📸

## 🐾 **The Problem:**
Wildlife tracking is expensive, time-consuming, and limited to a few experts. With **species extinction** on the rise, tracking biodiversity is crucial—but traditional methods just can't scale globally.

## 🌟 **Our Solution:**
Ether Go gamifies wildlife tracking, turning nature lovers into **citizen scientists**. Users capture animal sightings, and we store them as **immutable, on-chain records**. This helps conservation efforts, promotes environmental awareness, and brings the fun of **records** to millions. 🌎✨

## 🔥 **Why It’s Fun and Impactful:**
- **Catch ‘em all!** Just like Pokémon, collect animal records as you explore the world.
- **Conservation first:** Contribute to wildlife protection and tracking by simply snapping a pic!
- **Seamless onboarding:** Get millions of casual users into **blockchain** while having fun in nature!

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Ethereum**: Immutable blockchain to store wildlife records.
- **Next.js + React**: Our snappy, fun front-end!
- **Vercel**: Smooth deployments.
- **Smart Contracts**: Mint records and track animal sightings on-chain.
- **Dynamic Wallet Integration**: Seamless wallet connection for users.

## Integrations:

- [Polygon](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHGlobal-SF/blob/main/contracts/polygon.md)
- [Skale](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHGlobal-SF/blob/main/contracts/skale.md)
- [Flow](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHGlobal-SF/blob/main/contracts/flow.md)
- [Morph](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHGlobal-SF/blob/main/contracts/morph.md)

## 🦒 **How It Works:**
1. **See an Animal**: Spot an animal in the wild!
2. **Snap a Photo**: Capture the moment on your phone.
3. **Mint a record**: Turn that photo into a **blockchain**-backed record with species, time, and location info.
4. **Build Your EtherDex**: Collect and showcase all your wildlife sightings in your personal **EtherDex**.

## 🎯 **The Big Vision:**
We’re building the future of wildlife tracking—crowdsourcing it globally and building a decentralized database of animal species. 🐘🦜 By making conservation fun, Ether Go is bridging the gap between **technology** and **environmental protection**, one record at a time.

Join us on **Ether Go** and let’s **save the planet** while collecting awesome record memories! 🌍🐾
