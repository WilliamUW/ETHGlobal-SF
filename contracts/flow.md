My wildlife tracking app Ether Go, built on Flow EVM Testnet, is revolutionizing the way we protect our planet by making every wildlife sighting an immutable piece of data, accessible to all and permanent in the fight for conservation. By harnessing Flow EVM's incredible speed, security & scalability, we can onboard millions of Pokémon Go users into a global mission, turning their everyday interactions into real, tangible contributions to the preservation of endangered species and ecosystems. This app isn’t just a tool—it’s a movement, empowering people to actively participate in safeguarding biodiversity and providing an essential early-warning system for invasive species, all powered by the future of blockchain technology!

Feedback: It was very straight forward to deploy to the Flow EVM testnet and send transactions to the smart contract using viem! I love how you get 1000 testnet FLOW to test with, so I never felt restricted by testnet token availability and I could test to my heart's content. 

I love the speed and low fees of Flow, and deploying using Remix and testing the smart contract using Viem was a very positive experience for me!
