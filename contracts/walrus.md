My wildlife tracking app Ether Go, built on Walrus, is revolutionizing the way we protect our planet by making every wildlife sighting an immutable piece of data, accessible to all and permanent in the fight for conservation. My project leverages Walrus to immutably store base64 image data which would otherwise be too expensive to store onchain!

Very easy to use and start storing info!
