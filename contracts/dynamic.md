TLDR: My project uses Dynamic to facilitate EVM wallet login and facilitates sending of transactions to the smart contract!

My wildlife tracking app Ether Go is revolutionizing the way we protect our planet by making every wildlife sighting an immutable piece of data, accessible to all and permanent in the fight for conservation. By harnessing Dynamic's incredible ease of use, we can onboard millions of Pok√©mon Go users into a global mission, turning their everyday interactions into real, tangible contributions to the preservation of endangered species and ecosystems.

Very easy to use! I love how it only requires an env id to get started
